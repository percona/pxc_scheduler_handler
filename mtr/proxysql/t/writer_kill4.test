# 1. Setup 3 node PXC cluster
# 2. Setup ProxySQL 
#  node_1:          backup reader / backup writer
#  node_2: reader / backup reader / backup writer
#  node_3: writer / backup reader / backup writer
# 3. Setup ProxySQL scheduler with config passed in $pxc_scheduler_handler_config
# 4. shutdown writer
#   => node_2 promoted to writer, removed from readers
#   => node_3 status changed to SHUNED, node moved to hostgroup 9100
# 5. relaunch writer
#   => node_2 still writer because there is no FailBack
#   => node_3 status changed to ONLINE, node removed from hostgroup 9100, node added to reader hostrgroup 101
